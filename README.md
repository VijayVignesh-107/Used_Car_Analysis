# Used_Car_Analysis

Hi Peeps..!!!

The dataset i'm analysing here is based on used cars which has its features, current condition and selling price of the cars. I have taken this dataset from Kaggle, link is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manishkr1754/cardekho-used-car-data".

This dataset can be analysed using data science,to pridict the future trends of the car sale market in india.

The dataset has 13 columns which gives us unique information about a particular car in each and every aspect to analyse and visualize the data.
Description of the Dataset:

car_name: This column contains the name of the car. Since car brands produce multiple models, not every car attracts buyers equally. Some models are highly popular, while others are not. By analyzing this column, we can differentiate cars based on their names and understand which models from a particular brand attract more buyers. This can also help identify why certain models are more appealing based on other related attributes.

brand: This column specifies the car's brand name. In today’s competitive market, various brands offer a wide range of cars. The decision to buy is often influenced by a brand's legacy and the trust it has built over time. By studying this data, we can determine which brands are preferred by buyers and which are less popular, while analyzing these trends using other attributes in the dataset.

model: This column provides the car's model. Each car has different models catering to varying customer requirements. While the car name might remain the same, differences in specifications lead to varying price points. This column can help predict which models have higher resale values and identify the factors contributing to this.

seller_type: This column identifies the type of seller (individual or dealer). Some buyers prefer purchasing cars directly from owners to avoid paying a dealer’s commission, while others trust dealers for the assurance of better car conditions. By analyzing this column, we can study how sales are distributed between these two categories and which cars are popular under each type.

fuel_type: This column shows the type of fuel used by the car (e.g., petrol, diesel, CNG, electric). Modern cars are built to run on various fuel types, each with its own pros and cons. Analyzing this data can reveal which fuel types are most preferred by buyers and the price range of vehicles with different fuel types in the used car market.

transmission_type: This column indicates the car’s transmission type (manual or automatic). By examining this column, we can identify which transmission type is preferred in the used car market and its influence on buyers’ decisions.

vehicle_age: This column provides the car's age (in years). Generally, buyers in the used car market avoid older models. With advancements in technology, newer cars often offer better features, which buyers expect even in used cars. By analyzing this data, we can identify the preferred age range for used cars.

mileage: This column represents the car’s mileage. Rising fuel and energy costs have made mileage a critical factor for buyers. Most used car buyers prioritize mileage as a deciding factor. Analyzing this data can help identify patterns in buyer preferences.

km_driven: This column gives us the value of maximum kilometers teh car has ran till now. This also gives us insight of the engine life and usually lower kms car are preferred by the users.

engine: This column gives the engine’s displacement (in cc). The size of the engine affects both fuel consumption and mileage, which are key considerations for buyers. This column can help identify the preferred engine sizes in the used car market.

max_power: This column shows the maximum power (BHP) the car’s engine can produce, which determines its top speed. For some buyers, especially enthusiasts, this is a significant factor. By analyzing this column, we can understand its impact on buyer decisions.

seats: This column indicates the seating capacity of the car. The number of seats can influence decisions, especially for families or groups. Analyzing this column helps identify which seating configurations are most in demand.

selling_price: This column provides the market price of the used car. By analyzing all the above factors, we can study how they influence the selling price. This can help predict fair prices for cars in the future based on similar attributes.

Using the above data, I will apply Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to predict the potential selling prices of cars in the future, based on their features and trends in the dataset.
